    "**What is Hugging Face?**\n",
    "Hugging Face is an AI company known for developing user-friendly tools and libraries that make advanced machine learning models accessible and easy to use. Its core offerings include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Transformers Library: A popular library that provides state-of-the-art pre-trained models for NLP tasks like text classification, translation, and generation.\n",
    "    Datasets Library: A collection of datasets for various machine learning tasks, facilitating easy access and management of data.\n",
    "    Hugging Face Hub: An online platform for sharing and discovering machine learning models and datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `datasets` library from Hugging Face is a great way to work with high-quality speech data. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the `keithito/lj_speech` dataset from hugging face for LJ Speech dataset. To know the tag name of the the dataset you want on hugging face, you can try to search the name of your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step tutorial to help you get started with this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup**\n",
    "Before you start, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You'll need the `datasets` library from Hugging Face and potentially other libraries depending on your use case.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install datasets\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loading the Dataset**\n",

    "\n",
    "# Load the dataset\n",
    "dataset = load_dataset(\"keithito/lj_speech\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The load_dataset function fetches the dataset and returns it in a format that's easy to work with.\n",

    "The dataset typically contains audio files and their corresponding text transcriptions. To get more details about the structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Loading and Using the Audio Files\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to process or listen to the audio files, you can use libraries such as librosa or pydub for audio handling.\n",
